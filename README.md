Badminton Training and Performance Notes
Inspiration: This app was inspired by my badminton training habits that are often not well documented. With this app, I can record my training schedule, performance records, and personal goals, so I can track my progress and stay motivated.

## Description
This application is inspired by my personal experience as a badminton player. I frequently train, but rarely keep track of my progress in a structured way. Therefore, I created "BadmintLog" to help log technical and physical training sessions, as well as performance metrics over time.

## Features
- Add technical and physical training sessions
- Add performance logs (stamina & accuracy)
- View all logs
- Save and load data from JSON file

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Run with the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
